# Building Systems with the ChatGPT API

This project showcases practical applications of large language models (LLMs) using the ChatGPT API, based on the course by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI. It focuses on building intelligent, multi-step systems capable of automating complex workflows and enhancing human-AI interactions.

## üöÄ Overview

In this project, you will find implementations that demonstrate how to:

- Build **chains of prompts** where each step builds on the previous one.
- Combine **Python logic** with LLM completions to enable dynamic system behavior.
- Create a **customer service chatbot** capable of handling various user intents and queries.

These systems apply to real-world tasks such as:

- Classifying user queries and generating context-specific responses.
- Evaluating inputs for safety and appropriateness.
- Solving multi-step reasoning tasks using **Chain-of-Thought prompting**.

## üìö Learning Objectives

- **Split complex tasks** into a pipeline of subtasks using multistage prompts.
- **Build multi-step systems** with LLMs that can reason and respond contextually.
- **Evaluate inputs and outputs** for relevance, safety, and accuracy.
